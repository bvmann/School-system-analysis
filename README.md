analysis 
1. It appears that as a school's size by student population passes the 2,000 student mark, there is a decrease in passing grades and average scores. You could interpret this as teachers being stretched too thin and not able to give individual students enough attention. 

2. Another observation that can be made is that school type matters. It seems that charter schools have a higher rate of passing grades. This could be due to multiple different variables, such as a difference in curriculum or the caliber of the teachers. This observation gives rise to multiple questions that could be explored later on.
